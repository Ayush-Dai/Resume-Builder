Resume Builder Website Knowledge Base
====================================

Overview:
---------
This is a dynamic, user-friendly resume builder web application. It allows users to input their personal, professional, and educational information, and instantly preview their resume in multiple visually distinct templates. Users can export their resume as a PDF, ensuring it is print-ready and formatted for A4 paper.

Key Features:
-------------
1. **Dynamic Resume Form**: Users fill out a form with fields for personal info, job title, contact details, summary, skills, work experience, education, and professional links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio).
2. **Live Preview**: As users fill out the form, the resume preview updates in real time, reflecting all changes.
3. **Multiple Templates**: Users can choose from several unique, professionally designed templates (Modern, Classic, Professional, Gradient, Blue, etc.), each with robust default data and conditional rendering for missing fields.
4. **PDF Export**: Resumes can be exported as PDF, with all templates sized for A4 paper and print-ready.
5. **Robust Data Handling**: If any section (like experience or education) is empty, default example data is shown. Only sections with data are rendered.
6. **Professional Links**: GitHub, LinkedIn, and Portfolio links are supported and displayed in the header or footer, depending on the template.
7. **User-Friendly UI**: The form uses clear labels, icons, and helpful placeholders. Users can add or remove multiple experiences and education entries.

Data Structure:
---------------
All templates use a single data structure:

ResumeFormData {
  fullName: string
  jobTitle: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  address: string
  summary: string
  experience: Experience[]

  jobTitle: string
  company: string
  startDate: string
  endDate: string

}

}

How to Use:
-----------
1. Fill out the form with your details. Add as many experience and education entries as needed.
2. Choose a template to preview your resume.

Advanced Features:
------------------
- **Section Conditional Rendering**: Each resume section (Summary, Experience, Skills, Education, Links) is only displayed if the user has provided data for it. This keeps resumes clean and relevant.
- **Default Example Data**: When a section is empty, default example data is shown for preview purposes, helping users visualize the final output.
- **A4 Print Optimization**: All templates are designed to fit perfectly on A4 paper for both digital PDF export and physical printing.
- **Accessibility**: The UI uses clear labels, icons, and color contrast for better accessibility.
- **Responsive Design**: The form and preview are responsive, working well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Add/Remove Entries**: Users can dynamically add or remove multiple work experience and education entries.
- **Live Data Sync**: The form uses real-time data binding, so any change is instantly reflected in the preview.
- **Icon Integration**: Professional links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio) are displayed with recognizable icons for clarity.
- **Customizable Templates**: Developers can easily add new templates by following the `ResumeFormData` structure and conditional rendering logic.

Security & Privacy:
-------------------
- All data entered by users is handled locally in the browser and is not sent to any server by default.
- Users should ensure they do not share sensitive information when exporting or sharing their resume.
